                    Cheapskate architecture is about using the most economical means to achieve equal or higher level of
                    architectural delight (equal or higher when compared to contemporaries).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our current way of constructing a hermetically sealed building, each material used prefers a
                    single standardized role. Layers within walls creates barriers against air and light, while
                    mechanical equipments regulate an ideal air/light condition. In pursuit of a "cheapskate
                    architecture," how much of this architectural burden can we cut out, and still maintain the ideal
                    air/light condition? Or rather, should we pursue a different ideal in air/light, a shift in paradigm
                    away from the standard? And, would this new form still be cognizable as architecture?
                </p>

                    This project (and its twin project <a id="link" href="aw_2505_ced.html">aw_2505_ced</a>) builds on a
                    series of small moves that constructs a new architectural system different from the hermetically
                    sealed standard, and provides a different ideal air/light condition. The small moves include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. A deconstructed-conception of the wall. Here, a sandwich wall is not treated as a single
                    monolithic element, but rather a collection of individual parts that can be reduced in number when
                    needed. Not all walls need insulation. Not all walls need two layers of sheathing. Not
                    all walls need sealed windows, just a hole in the wall might work better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Defining spaces not by material-heavy walls, but by furnitures and shifts in platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. The shifts in platforms create gaps in architectural assemblies, allowing light and air to flow
                    freely. Lighting and ventilation are thus harder to be regulated by mechanical systems, forcing
                    better consideration of passive strategies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Standardized 4-step step-ladders between platforms. Mobile and easy to mass-produce.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. Dimensioned materials are used as-is-to-dimension (as much as possible). This reduces waste and
                    labor time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    6. Overall reduction of glass and polycarbonate sheathing. This drastically reduces the material
                    cost and carbon footprint. Opening are mostly left as holes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    7. Preference for wood post and lintel structure. Wood is cheaper as well as less carbon-intensive
                    than steel. Post and lintel structure is also easier for future adaptive reuse, or to have the
                    materials deconstructed for reuse.
                </p>
