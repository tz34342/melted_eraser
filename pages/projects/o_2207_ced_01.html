                <p>A table light’s primary function is simply to bring
                    light to a working surface, but it also does way more&mdash;by the means of the table light, an
                    individual
                    regains their agency to act, to observe, and to
                    produce in darkness. In other words, the individual
                    regains their freedom to create. However, any rigid
                    material in table lights will be inclined to limit the
                    freedom of the light. The light is either forcibly
                    directed by the structure, or fixed in dimensions.
                    What if the material used in a table light does
                    not limit the light, but instead to support it, to
                    accentuate the light’s quality of freedom?</p>
                <p>In <em>Karaoke</em>, the cardboard, by being torn apart by
                    hand, is devoid of rigid structures and obvious
                    support/fixations of the light. The LED light
                    bulbs are similarly composed in a freeform way,
                    with exposed wires alone acting as support. The
                    cardboards flow naturally around the light source,
                    as if it is shattered and reformed by the light.
                    Two additional choices, the neon pink threads
                    and voice activated light, parallels the user to the
                    light. The user yells to have the light reach peak
                    brightness, symbolically as a burst of passion that
                    explodes the rigid cardboard, yet with neon pink
                    threads, a deliberately human act, the user holds the
                    cardboards together in a new form. The user/light
                    holds over the fate of the cardboards.</p>
