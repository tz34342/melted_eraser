                <p>The “Social Condenser” is an architectural typology
                    developed in the Soviet Union of the early 1900s.
                    Central to the typology is the ideal of the architecture
                    and architect’s power and responsibility in shaping
                    social behavior. Social condensers aim to challenge
                    contemporary social hierarchies through the collision
                    and condensation of daily activities, which creates
                    forced interactions between people who would
                    otherwise have no interaction at all, and therefore
                    creating a greater communal consciousness.</p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately with the proof of time, social condenser
                    projects were not entirely successful in all their goals.
                    The complex nature of individuals and communities
                    makes it so that technocratic housing projects like the
                    Smithson couple’s “Robin Hood Garden” are usually
                    unsuccessful in creating a cohesive community.
                </p>
                <p><em>A Tower of Babel</em> is a modern take on the social
                    condenser project. Located near UC Berkeley’s
                    campus, it is a building that combines a basketball
                    court, two pickleball courts, several classrooms, art
                    studios, and offices into one building. Like many
                    places across the United States, Berkeley could do well
                    with a welcoming third space that fosters a better
                    established city-community.</p>
                <p>
                    The experiment is not conducted the same way
                    of a-hundred-years-ago just to yield the same
                    unsatisfying results, but rather with a touch of cynical
                    performatism. The name “A Tower of Babel” is an
                    obvious allusion to the biblical story “Tower of Babel.”
                    In the same vein to that story, challenge against the
                    social norm fails, because the predetermined “norm”
                    causes people to organize ineffectively. However,
                    the immediate functions of a social condenser is still
                    desirable, people always need a space to gather, to
                    exercise and compete, to learn and meditate. <em>A Tower of Babel</em> takes this important
                    behavioral base, and
                    performs it. With maximum exposure, the building
                    performs its interior spaces to external viewers. From
                    a distance, it is impossible for viewers to tell if all
                    people within this building are organizing effectively.
                    The performative exposure of <em>A Tower of Babel</em> creates
                    images of one indisputable fact, that people of different
                    social groups are existing near each other. People, are
                    together.

                    A subversive idea to a conservative society must
                    be articulated unabashedly and repeatedly, until it
                    becomes hegemonic, just as how conservative ideas of
                    any current time period are hegemonic through their
                    daily reinforcement, their control of the mainstream.
                    No “natural ideas” are natural and self-evident! Social
                    condensers, individually, are failures, but repeatedly,
                    it becomes a tradition of typology. The biblical
                    Babel was a failure, but to recreate a Babel today, is a
                    continuation of a past-initiated challenge against the
                    norm. It is to perform a “coherent community” once
                    again, and to sow seeds for actual change.
