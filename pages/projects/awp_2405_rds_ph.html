                <p>Architecture is perhaps one of the only things
                    running against the current world. As the world is
                    getting faster and faster, with acceleration in the
                    pace we produce and consume media and products,
                    architecture, with its inherent nature, still takes time
                    to design, to assemble, and to use.</p>
                <p>The Red Dot School gained rights to deconstruct
                    an abandoned house on Sagishima, a rural island
                    facing population decline. Instead of demolishing
                    the house into a landfill, Red Dot School deliberately
                    chose a different approach, a long-time-span slow-deconstruction that will allow the cataloging and
                    reuse of most of the material that made up the house.</p>
                <p>To bring the slowness of architecture’s construction
                    phase into the deconstruction phase is a conscious choice, meant to challenge the default model of
                    real estate development. Demolition of buildings
                    creates enormous amounts of waste, exacerbating
                    our ongoing climate catastrophe. But our default real
                    estate model encourages demolition, for land is an
                    asset that needs immediate reinvestment. What value
                    is exhibited and preserved when we can deconstruct
                    slowly, step by step exposing a building’s structures,
                    and therefore its history?</p>
                <p>As we deconstructed this abandoned house, we
                    found evidence of expansions and repairs, pointing
                    to reorganization of the living space in the history
                    of use. The material used for repair also tells the
                    age of the building, older repair materials are more
                    natural-wood-based while the newer materials are
                    more synthetically produced. Most of the structural
                    elements (the beams, the columns) also have joinery-
                    mortise that signals connections to structural
                    elements that are not present in this house. Therefore,
                    these wooden beams and columns must have been
                    reused from previous deconstructed buildings. We
                    could not tell how many times these elements were
                    reused, but we were certain that they deserved care
                    and future reused. To demolish these elements of
                    history into a landfill would be a tragedy.</p>
                <p>This is a building of time. We kept a realistic timeline
                    for deconstruction work and understood we could
                    not fully deconstruct this house within 14 days. Thus
                    we left the structure exposed, turning the house into
                    a pavilion that is waiting to be fully deconstructed by
                    the next group of students visiting in 4 months.</p>
                <p>
                    It is a 1:1 scale mikoshi (a small portable shrine
                    constructed and carried by the community
                    around town during festivals). It is a sacred space
                    deconstructed through collective labor from all Red
                    Dot School students, instructors, and guests new and
                    old. Instead of moving geographically, this mikoshi
                    instead moves through time. It will sit through the
                    natural weathering of Sagishima’s ocean climate, as
                    well as daily use of the local villagers.
