                <p>This project was requested by Cal Raijin Taiko’s
                    leadership for the spring 2024 semester’s end-of-
                    the-school-year show. With the goal of bringing
                    more color and energy to the group, the leadership
                    specifically asked for a pair of “matoi,” which was
                    traditionally used for Japanese fire fighting, and
                    nowadays for festive celebrations.</p>
                <p>
                    I was given free-reign over the project, and several
                    variations were considered. Ultimately, I landed on the
                    current version of the matoi, which I believe are most
                    representative of Raijin’s unabashed joy and explosive
                    energy in their performances. Instead of a more
                    traditional proportion and standard “box-like” head-
                    banner design, a single exaggerated kanji of “thunder”
                    was used. “Raijin” means “God of Thunder,” and
                    thus the kanji of thunder works well as an insignia
                    for Cal Raijin Taiko. The kanji, used in exaggeration,
                    also creates the effect of synesthesia, or “visualized
                    sound effect.” The directed swings of the matoi
                    create no external audible sound on its own, but they
                    rather invoke sounds of thunder, of explosive spirit,
                    internally within the audience’s minds.
