                <p>A building is an organization of material in an
                    instance of time. The scheme of this organization is
                    dependent on the building occupant’s desired uses and
                    programs.</p>
                <p>57-69 Windward Avenue used to be the residence of
                    artist Robert Graham and actress Anjelica Huston.
                    The buildings’ initial programs, as desired by the two,
                    were a full residence and a full artist studio, and thus
                    it was originally organized as two equal masses, with
                    mirroring silhouettes (residence on west and studio on
                    east).</p>
                <p>As the buildings changed hands, the residence was
                    no longer needed. The buildings were re-organized
                    into its current state, with the residence demolished
                    into a flat ground for parking and for hosting events.
                    Demolition is a form of reorganization, because
                    the material technically still exists&mdash;it just got
                    reorganized into a landfill.</p>

                <p>Now, the programs ask for a more comprehensive
                    art manufacturing area. I was interested in if it is
                    possible to create a new building, not by demolishing
                    the materials into a landfill, but rather reorganizing
                    these materials into a new form according to new
                    programs. As the existing studio building is made of
                    steel structure and prefab composite panels, I see this
                    potential for reorganization.</p>
                <p>The artist residence is housed in the existing west
                    building. The manufacturing space prefers flat
                    ground, so I pushed most of the material on the
                    second floor and above in the studio building into
                    the open ground area, reorganized into a new
                    building. The new building also houses meeting
                    rooms, classrooms, and exhibition space. What is left
                    untouched in the studio building is also intentional,
                    it creates a nice new silhouette for the elevation,
                    overlooking the rest of the buildings as well as Venice
                    Beach. It now acts as the material archive.</p>
                <p>
                    The material, when treated as individual parts
                    available to be reorganized, also has agency in
                    themselves, giving me inspiration and guidance. For
                    example, the undulation of the new roof form is
                    derived from existing roof connections. The pre-fab
                    panels already have apertures cut into them, which
                    are preserved and create interesting points of friction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is only a rudimentary study of parts to a
                    building, because architecture is the summation
                    of many different and complex systems, structural
                    material being only one of them. For example, I did
                    not have available time to consider the infrastructural electricity and water systems, the
                    circulation of
                    people and smaller objects, and Los Angeles’ local
                    climates. But this approach is a critical first step
                    towards rethinking what it means to be an architect,
                    and architecture’s environmental impacts.
