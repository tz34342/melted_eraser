                <p>The 8th floor dorm flooded after the heavy rainstorm
                    during my first semester at Berkeley. The school took
                    off the ceiling tile and lights but never fixed the roof,
                    so we decided to put up our own “ceiling and light.”
                    The new ceiling floats below and exposes the hole.
                    Water-filled condoms are used instead of lightbulbs.
                    The two choices act as continued reminders of UC
                    Berkeley’s inaction, and that one more day without
                    ceiling and light is one more day “showered in rain.”</p>
                <p>Nearly all material used in the installation are salvaged
                    material. The condoms are expired condoms donated
                    from a dear friend Lily Talley. Salvaged materials are
                    not uniform in nature, and thus the composition was
                    particularly challenging.</p>
                <p>The installation was highly effective. The ceiling hole
                    was patched one day after the installation was put up.
                    However whoever fixed the ceiling also threw away
                    the installation without notice.</p>
