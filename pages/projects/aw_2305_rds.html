                <p>Across Japan, especially in the countryside, a
                    condition called akiya persists. Translated literally,
                    akiya means “empty house.” It is the condition
                    when an owner has left behind their old house for
                    so long, the house has fallen into disrepair. Reasons
                    for moving away are varied but typical, such as
                    population loss in rural areas and effects of an aging
                    population. Such a condition is troublesome both
                    for the owner and the community: the owner does
                    not wish to destroy a place of memories, while the
                    community sees an empty house as a potential hazard.
                    The Deconstruction Ceremony (a play on the traditional
                    groundbreaking ceremony) is resolution to the owner-community relationship through a three day
                    long ceremony.</p>
                <p>
                    Within this group work, I am specifically responsible
                    for designing the guidelines to a “Composition
                    Ritual.” In a mock performance of this ritual, I
                    communicated the view that “deconstruction” is not
                    only the instance when the house is torn down, but
                    rather a continuous process throughout a house’s life
                    (ex. the energy systems that passes through a house,
                    the exchange of hands of furnitures and daily items,
                    community assistance with repairs and remodels,
                    the circulation of people and guests). I acted as a master of ceremony, guiding participants of this
                    ritual (owner of the house and community members)
                    through actions that make them realize how a house
                    is in fact an open system, constantly constructed and
                    deconstructed by their communities.

                    This work also resulted in a manual similar to the
                    instructional arts of Yoko Ono and Sol LeWitt.
                    The instructions are specific in action, but flexible
                    in interpretation, meant to reflect the owner and
                    community’s individual-and-different mental images
                    of the house. For example, one of the instructions
                    asks the participants to arrange “tiresome” items. Although the way to arrange these items as
                    explicitly
                    stated, the participant would interpret what it means
                    to be “tiresome” very differently. A tool for labor for
                    one might be a tool of hobby for another.
