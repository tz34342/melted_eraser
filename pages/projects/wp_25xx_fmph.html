                    <p>"You have twice visited a small island in Japan named Sagishima. As you step foot on Sagishima,
                        you will recognize the wisdom of the elders, the hopes of the youth, but not conflicts of your
                        contemporaries. <br><br>The sea shimmers. Waves, across waves, striking waves, sending back
                        waves, waves, that
                        you in dreams all images shimmers, refracts, strikes and mirrors. <br><br>Sagishima is a
                        secluded respite. Your
                        stay in brief, never exceeding your welcome. You take your leave as you dip your toes into the
                        water. The freeze of the sea cannot penetrate your regained
                        fortitude. <br><br>You wade further, and further, pushing across waves, striking waves, sending
                        back waves, further, until your head no longer feels the air, your feet far removed from the
                        sand-mud. In the water,
                        infinite instances of you begin to shimmer, refract, strike and mirror&mdash;actions and
                        reactions, causes and effects, all that is assumed logical dissolves into the sea that defines
                        your
                        sanctuary, Sagishima."</p>

                <p>I have a particular love for Sagishima, and I wish to remember it somehow through my favorite medium
                    of photography. This collection of photos can be viewed as documentary in nature, but also as an
                    expression of my emotions when I lived on the island. Waves pushing waves, receiving replies through
                    echoes, and I too, one day, will return to Sagishima, as if I never left. </p>
