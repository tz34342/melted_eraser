                Architecture is no longer about novel form. Since half a century ago, architecture has been,
                and should have been, pursued as a masterful manipulation of information.
            </p>
            <p>
                From August to October of 2024, Farshid Moussavi of Harvard Graduate School of Design held an
                exhibition, named “Architecture as an Instruction-Based Art.”<sup>1</sup> With the rise of
                professionalism in the
                late 19th
                century, the design of architecture became further and further detached from the actual construction
                process.
                In most contemporary practices, architects do not labor as constructors. Moussavi herself summarized it
                the best: “the unique role of architects is to conceive the concepts that dictate the precise
                arrangement of all
                elements in a building. These concepts not only define how a building will occupy its space and time,
                but how it will also
                influence the people and the environment that the building relates to.”<sup>2</sup>

                Instructional art is not a new concept. It originated around the 60s with works such as Yoko Ono’s
                <em>Grapefruit</em>, or Sol Lewit with his reproducible wall drawings. Ono writes short instructions
                that force
                the readers to reinterpret their world through careful examination of details or actions rarely taken,
                and Lewit writes concise yet interpretive instructions for art-laborers to draw. Their contemporary, Nam
                June Paik, first exhibited his work <em>Zen for TV</em> in 1963, where he finely manipulated a cathode
                ray tube
                television to display only a single line of light. <em>Zen for TV</em> lives on, and is able to be
                reproduced
                year after year for exhibitions, for it is not the TV that is the art, but rather Nam’s diagrams and
                instructions. These instructions tell galleries how to reproduce his results, allowing laborers to
                reproduce his art again and again across many cathode ray tubes through the ages.<sup>3</sup>

            <p>
                A decade later, Venturi and Scott Brown published <em>Learning from Las Vegas</em>,<sup>4</sup> a book
                architecture students
                mostly remember for its differentiation between the duck and the decorated shed. Yet, the key argument
                Venturi and Scott Brown proposed through the example of Las Vegas is that architecture is no longer tied
                directly to the constraints of physical matters, but rather it is freed to a space of pure semiosis, of
                information and signs. Their claim parallels the development in the art world. Art and architecture can
                live on in the conceptual, the instructional. Nam further developed his ideas on media and information.
                In 1974, he submitted a report titled “Media Planning for the Post Industrial Society—The 21st Century
                is now only 26 years away”<sup>5</sup> to the Art Program of the Rockefeller Foundation. In it, Nam
                projected a far
                more advanced development of mass-media technology in the American landscape dubbed the “electronic
                superhighway:” a media network made of “audio cassettes, telex, data pooling, continental satellites,
                microfiches, private microwaves and eventually, fiber optics on laser frequencies.” In 1989, the World
                Wide Web was invented, establishing the foundations of this superhighway. Today, people sprint down this
                highway at incomprehensible speeds, with all information and signs of the world flashing past their eyes
                almost in a blur, existing yet intangible, illegible.
            </p>
            <p>
                But architects should not follow the flow of the information highway. In this accelerating world, time
                and space and images and information are compressed before our eyes in our phones and computers.
                Buildings do not subscribe to that acceleration, they take a long time to realize. Buildings are slow
                and careful. To design and construct a building is to navigate through the financial systems that fund
                the building, the material sourcing, logistics, and assembly that make up the building, the labor
                conditions and organizations of architectural and construction workers who form the building, and the
                social and political impacts on communities that engage with the building. Architecture is the highest
                form of instructional art. Moussavi’s exhibition is not merely an exhibition of instructions for
                laborers or rudimentary concepts, but also a detailed delineation of information systems that literally
                control every aspect of our daily lives. Architecture is able to operate as instructional art, because
                architecture is information.

            </p>
            <p>
                More and more critical architectural practices today advocate for the reuse of existing structures
                instead of building new ones. Such conversations are typically framed in the urgency of the climate
                catastrophe, that reuse should be a preferred alternative to new because of reuse’s friendlier
                environmental impacts. Such a narrative is a result of an unclear observation of the progression in
                architectural theories&mdash;reuse is not the alternative. It is the next stage of the new. It is more
                refined and more empowering to architects, for reuse is the re-organization of existing structure,
                program, and semiosis, all information systems that dictate the new. To pursue reuse is to finally
                clarify this information, to distill the systems and their parts, and to master the
                instructional-art-nature of professional architectural practices.

                In <em>Log 47</em>, Elisa Iturbe, who now teaches at GSD, wrote an incredibly insightful article named
                “Architecture and the Death of Carbon Modernity.”<sup>6</sup> Iturbe took a critical examination of what
                she called
                “carbon form.” With each shift in humanity’s means to capture energy comes a new spatial and
                architectural paradigm, the current paradigm being that of the carbon. Iturbe argued you can see it in
                various architectural typologies as well as daily objects: fast food chains, motels, department stores,
                and the internet. More importantly, these physical forms are “carbon forms” because they exist as, and
                are the product of, the cultural or behavioral patterns that propagate petro-culture. As stated by
                Iturbe, “a spinach leaf in itself is not a carbon form. But a spinach leaf grown with petroleum-based
                pesticides and fertilizers, sown and harvested with gasoline-fueled machinery, packed in a plastic
                container, delivered on a truck, and sold in an air-conditioned Walmart superstore surrounded by open
                expanses of asphalt is, if not a carbon form in itself, a commodity that circulates within a complex
                network of carbon forms and defines specific relationships within that network.”

                The same goes for the built environment. The Palazzo Barberini in Rome, built before fossil fuels,
                includes a ramp with the precise slope and width for a horse carriage. The dimensionalized form of
                Palazzo Barberini registers directly to the power and movement of humans and animals. Carbon
                revolutionized this mobility. Villa Savoye, built in 1929, is a carbon form as its ground floor plan
                explicitly registers with the turning radius of automobiles. Architecture is not the representation of
                energy—it is the energy system itself. The Modernists, in their time, were praised for their ability to
                challenge existing social fabrics through heroic novel forms. With our current development in historical
                and theoretical insights, we now see that Modernism was not really about creating a “new,” as our
                limited scope led us to believe. Modernism was simply a response to the newly arisen carbon systems,
                giving them physical form.<sup>7</sup>

                To save us from the climate catastrophe, we need to move away from petroculture, carbon systems, and
                enter a new age of better energy, or even “no energy,” systems. Similar to how the Modernists gave form
                to carbon, architects today must overcome petroculture-thinking and generate a new form for the new age.
                It will take architects who do not merely follow the information highway, but rather those who guide the
                traffic itself. Architects need to understand the myths of the new, be willing to delve deep into the
                systems, and wield the instructions which dictate these systems. Reuse is the current best approach to
                save us from climate catastrophe, not simply because it gives less carbon footprint as an alternative,
                but because its fundamental underpinning is progression trying to break free from carbon forms. When we
                use material, we contend with information. Petroculture has pushed us so far that building materials are
                inseparable from global sourcing. Around 1970, the International Organization for Standardization
                systematized shipping containers so that each container had a unique and traceable number. If you
                construct a data cloud of all containers in existence, you could literally predict the form of
                tomorrow’s world. What if reuse does not simply imply updating existing structures, but rather that all
                materials in a building are serialized, similar to containers, so that when taken apart the materials
                are standardized and reorganizable today, tomorrow, and indefinitely? What if the organization of these
                materials, once completely serialized, can create buildings easily reorganizable to satiate the
                accelerating rate in the changes of human desires, desires to consume new and differentiated programs?
                Can we read the forms of these new buildings not through permanent and extractive fixtures, but rather
                through semiotic understandings of instructions?
            </p>
            <p>
                The information highway’s compression of time and space&mdash;its trajectory towards
                hyper-consumption&mdash;gives
                rise to the climate catastrophe that needs new solutions, new forms. This new “information form” is
                reuse, or rather a more developed version of reuse. It is a form of minimum extraction, of systems and
                parts infinitely reorganizable and reproducible. “The net is vast and limitless,” but we have yet taken
                that first step.
